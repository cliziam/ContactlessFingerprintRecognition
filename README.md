# Contactless Fingerprint Recognition
Project for the course of Biometric Systems a.y. 2022-23.


In today's digital age, biometric systems, particularly fingerprint recognition, have become crucial for personal identification and authentication due to their reliability and robustness against fraud. The uniqueness of fingerprint patterns makes them ideal for identification. Contactless fingerprinting is a recent advancement that eliminates the need to press a hand against a device, using only a camera and an app for recording and analysis. However, the contactless approach presents challenges in terms of image quality and preprocessing. This project aims to construct and evaluate a contactless fingerprint-based biometric system using a dataset of finger images and various feature extraction algorithms.
